Image file size and <img> sizes are totally different things!

We should use different size of image files for SEO and UX

border: border-width border-style border-color|initial|inherit;

Border has 3 main sub properties:
1. border-width
2. border-style !!! Must !!!
3. border-color

We can combine all these 3 in one CSS property with optional orde. But border-style is a must!

eg:
border: 5px solid #00ffff;

margin: auto to align on the midle

Border has 4 different sizes and all these 4 are able to set individually.

Also we can combine 3 properties (width, style and color) for one side.
!!!But we can not combine 3 properties and sides differently in one property.

border-left: 5px solid #00ffff;

border: 5px solid #00ffff 2px dashed #00ff00 2px solid #ffffff 1px dashed #00ffff
